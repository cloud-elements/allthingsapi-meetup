First Meetup, covered basics as well as best practices and design of a REST API.

General agenda:
This meet up is for API practitioners, implementors and developers to come together to share their experience and learnings on defining, designing, building, launching, managing and consuming APIs based on REST/SOAP/JSON/XML technologies.


We'll focus on how to develop REST APIs, different authentication types, (like OAuth1, OAuth2, Basic, etc.) and various integrations. Also, we'll discuss on how these technologies impact different business units like CRM, ERP, etc.
